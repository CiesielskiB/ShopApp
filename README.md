# ShopApp
Application made to introduce me to ASP.net MVC5 based on MVC 5 course. It showed me how to manage my project, how to use MVC pattern in it's core. It is suppoused to serve as a simple shop, where customers can add products to cart, and Admin could add different items to the list of avaliable products.
